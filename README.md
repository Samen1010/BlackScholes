# ðŸ§¬ Mathematical Modeling for Cell & Bacteria Populations

This repository explores the deep interplay between mathematical ideologies and biological systems, showcasing how models like **Black-Scholes**â€”originally developed for option pricingâ€”can be applied to understand tumor and bacteria population dynamics. 

Inspired by works from **Lawrence Wein**, **Sinkala & Nkalashe**, **Tarynn Witten**, and **TamÃ¡s Vicsek**, we developed simulations to model tumor growth, immune response, and bacterial behavior in predator-prey scenarios.

## ðŸ”¬ Overview

The **Black-Scholes equation**, a second-order PDE known for its use in financial modeling, leverages Brownian motion to depict stochastic behaviors. Interestingly, similar stochastic behaviors emerge in **tumor growth**, **immune response**, and **bacterial interactions**.

### Our work tests the interdisciplinary power of these mathematical tools by:

- Simulating tumor-immune dynamics using logistic and enhanced models
- Modeling bacterial behavior through flocking and quorum sensing systems
- Drawing parallels between biological randomness and financial stochasticity

## ðŸ§ª Models Developed

### ðŸ§  Black-Scholes PDE
- **Core Idea**: Random walks and volatility map to cell proliferation and mutation
- **Key Insight**: Time-independent solution shows reduced growth away from the origin

### ðŸ§¬ Tumor-Immune System Models
- **Core Model (Tarynn Witten)**: Tumor vs. normal cells with logistic growth
- **Enhanced Model**:
  - Adds effector cells, IL-2, and virus dynamics
  - Tumor growth stabilizes with effector intervention
  - Normal cells dominate long-term under immune stimulation

### ðŸ¦  Bacteria Interaction Models (by Drew Neiman)
- **Flocking Model**: Simulates predator-prey interactions and accelerated death
- **Quorum Sensing**: Bacteria deposit chemicals and communicate for survival
  - Emergent clustering and death rates match observed biological behaviors

## ðŸ“‰ Results & Insights

- Tumor cells exhibit logistic and spatial decay behaviors analogous to stock prices
- Effector cells and IL-2 create stabilizing feedback, halting unchecked tumor growth
- Bacterial models show consistent trends in mortality and communication-driven adaptation
- Time-independent GBM solution: Growth rates decay as distance from the origin increases
